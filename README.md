# PythonAPI_OpenScienceProjectsMarketplace
This is a API written in Python for NASA Space Apps Challenge: 'A Marketplace for Open Science Projects'

There are many different open science and open-source projects and tools, but no efficient way to match project creators with interested collaborators who possess the skills required to contribute. Your challenge is to create a solution that will help people who are looking for open-source projects to work on and project creators who need skilled contributors to find each other and communicate.
